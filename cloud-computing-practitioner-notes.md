<h1>Cloud Concepts </h1>

<blockquote>What is Cloud Computing? </blockquote>

<br>

##### <strong>Cloud Computing</strong>: the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than on a local server or personal computer.

<br>

<blockquote>Six Advantages and Benefits</blockquote>
<br>

-   1 : Trade capital expense for variable expense

    -   No upfront-cost: In the past companies would have to pay for all of data centers and servers

    -   Pay On-Demand: Companies only pay for the resources they consume or use.

-   2 : Benefit from massive economics of scale

    -   AWS and other cloud providers serve a huge market of consumers. The cost of using a cloud service provider like AWS is significantly cheaper because you are sharing the cost with other customers.

    -   It allows you to have access to resources that would normally be very expensive, but it's a shared cost.

-   3 : Stop guessing capacity

    -   Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs.

    -   Instead of paying for idle or under-utilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.

-   4 : Increased speed and agility

    -   Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks for your IT to implement the solution on- premise.

-   5 : Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers

    -   Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers.

    -   If a company doesn't have to build their own data center they save money on the amount of employees needed.

    -   Companies save money by not spending money on unnecessary hardware.

-   6 : Go global in minutes

    -   Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks.

    -   Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

    -   In minutes you can quickly run servers in Asia, Europe and North America.
