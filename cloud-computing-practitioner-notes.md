# <b>Cloud Concepts</b>

<br>

---

## <b>SECTION 1: What is Cloud Computing?</b>

---

<br>

    The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than on a local server or personal computer.

<br>

## On-premise vs Cloud Providers:

### On-premise

-   You own the servers
-   You hire the IT people
-   You pay or rent the real-estate
-   You take all the risk.

### Cloud Providers

-   Someone else owns the servers
-   Someone else hires the IT people
-   Someone else pays or rents the real-estate
-   You are responsible for configuring your cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

## <b> SECTION 2: Six Advantages and Benefits</b>

---

<br>

-   Trade capital expense for variable expense

    -   No upfront-cost: In the past companies would have to pay for all of data centers and servers

    -   Pay On-Demand: Companies only pay for the resources they consume or use.

-   Benefit from massive economics of scale

    -   AWS and other cloud providers serve a huge market of consumers. The cost of using a cloud service provider like AWS is significantly cheaper because you are sharing the cost with other customers.

    -   It allows you to have access to resources that would normally be very expensive, but it's a shared cost.

-   Stop guessing capacity

    -   Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs.

    -   Instead of paying for idle or under-utilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.

-   Increased speed and agility

    -   Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks for your IT to implement the solution on- premise.

-   Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers

    -   Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers.

    -   If a company doesn't have to build their own data center they save money on the amount of employees needed.

    -   Companies save money by not spending money on unnecessary hardware.

-   6 : Go global in minutes

    -   Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks.

    -   Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

    -   In minutes you can quickly run servers in Asia, Europe and North America.

## <b>SECTION 3: Cloud Computing models</b>

---

### There are three main models of Cloud Computing:

<br>

    SaaS - Software as a Service
    PaaS- Platform as a Service
    IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service

<br>

### 1. IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service (Host)

    Most basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure. It has the most flexibility and management control of all the different cloud computing models. It is the closest to having a traditional on-premises data center.

#### Examples:

-   Amazon Web Services
-   Microsoft Azure
-   Google Cloud

<br>

### 2. PaaS- Platform as a Service (Build)

    Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. Less flexibility than IaaS because of pre-constructed packages.

#### Examples:

-   AWS Elastic Beanstalk
-   Windows Azure
-   Heroku
-   Google App Engine

<br>

### 3. SaaS- Software as a Service (Consume)

    Completed projects managed by a service provider. Easy to use and comes complete with a user interface. Least flexibility

#### Examples:

-   Gmail
-   Adobe Creative Cloud

## <b>SECTION 4: Cloud Development Models</b>

---

### There are three different types of deployment models for Cloud Computing.

-   Cloud Deployment

    -   100% of IT infrastructure is on the cloud.
    -   All of a companies applications were migrated to or created on the cloud.
    -   Helps to remove roadblocks of costly and time consuming procurement processes for on-premises infrastructure (big servers and data centers!).
    -   Great for small businesses and start-ups.

-   On-premises(Private cloud) Deployment

    -   Use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers.
    -   Resembles traditional IT infrastructure with big servers, data centers, etc.
    -   Do not get the same benefits of cloud computing (ability to easily scale up and down on demand)
    -   Company has dedicated resources that are not shared with others(good for security)
    -   Resources cannot be accessed using the internet
    -   Typically older large companies or owned by Government organizations

-   Hybrid Deployment

    -   Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources
    -   Great for established companies that had a dedicated data center but also wants to migrate processes over to the cloud
    -   Data is partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises
    -   Popular in the Fin Tech space

<br>
<blockquote>When you think of Cloud, think of small startups.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you think of Hybrid, think of Fin Tech Companies</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you think of On-premise, think of large old companies or companies that are beholden to Government Regulations.</blockquote>

## <b><i>SECTION 5</i>: Cloud Hosting</b>

---

<br>

### Types of Hosting

-   Dedicated Server​

    -   One physical machine dedicated to single a business​
    -   Runs a single web-app/site.​
    -   Very Expensive, High Maintenance, \*High Security​

-   Virtual Private Server​

    -   The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines
    -   Runs multiple web-apps/sites​
    -   Better Utilization and Isolation of Resources​

-   Shared Hosting​

    -   One physical machine, shared by hundred of businesses​
    -   Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources.​
    -   Very Cheap, Limited functionality, Poor Isolation​

-   Cloud Hosting​
    -   Multiple physical machines that act as one system ​
    -   The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services​
    -   Flexible, Scalable, Secure, Cost-Effective, High Configurability​
